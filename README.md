Website about Automotive industry in the United Kingdom

This is a project made in my first year of University for Web Development class. I designed a website that contains information about Automotive industry in the United Kingdom. It was made using HTLM5, CSS3 and JavaScript. I did not use any JavaScript frameworks or libraries.

I made the project alone and it took 2 weeks to complete: One week for the HTML and CSS part, and the other was for the JavaScript part.
